This task involved designing a simple interactive sales dashboard using Tableau. The dataset (Sales.csv) was first cleaned in Python using Pandas, where the Order Date was converted to a Month-Year format. The dashboard consists of three visuals: a line chart showing sales trends over time, a bar chart showing sales by region, and a donut chart highlighting category-wise sales distribution. Filters were added to enable interactivity by region and category. The dashboard helps identify top-performing regions, observe sales trends, and analyze category contributions effectively.
